Abstract
========

The type system introduced in PEP 484 relies on stub files to help
type checkers understand standard library and third-party modules,
but there is currently no standard way for authors of third-party
modules to distribute stub files for their code.

This PEP proposes a standardized way for library authors to
distribute stub files that can be found and used by type checkers.
